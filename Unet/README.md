<br>

* U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg. 
* The network is based on the fully Convolutional neural network and its architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentation.
